‚óè Created a comprehensive fraud detection NoSQL Bench workload with:

  Schema: Two tables modeling realistic fraud detection patterns:
  - transactions: Main table with full transaction details
  - user_transactions: Time-ordered view for pattern analysis

  Workload Configuration:
  - Rampup: 100,000 records inserted
  - Main phase: 10,000 ops/sec total (50/50 read/write split = 5,000 each)
  - Threads: 50 threads to handle the load
  - Target: HCD cluster in perf-hq5ru64r namespace

  Size Estimates:
  - Single write: ~200 bytes
  - Single read: ~500 bytes (average)
  - Total throughput: ~3.5 MB/sec (1MB writes + 2.5MB reads)
